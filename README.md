# MDTaufan.com Web Application

###--Work in progress--
This is the application for my personal website [*MDTaufan.com*](http://www.mdtaufan.com/) using Rails 5.0.0.
I am not only trying to port the old version of MDTaufan.com repository to support Rails 5, but am also trying to refactor the codes, employ Rspec with Capybara as the test suite and perhaps replacing Devise with my own authentication codes that I learn from the Internet. The project is currently ongoing, hence the staging address is [*MDTaufan.com staging area*](https://secret-sierra-55724.herokuapp.com)
